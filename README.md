# Rock Paper Scissors

[Hacking with SwiftUI: 100 days challenge](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui)

Project 3 (Challenge)

# How the game works:

Beat the game's move, whether the game wants you to win or lose, you have to make the right move, you're only losing points if you're trying to win when you should lose or lose when you should win.
This is a great brain exercise.
You have 10 rounds and a score.
